# Introduction
This a data exploratory project that I did using python to explore the field of data science as well as the various different jobs and aspects such as : salaries, remote ratio, top job titles, etc. The objective of this analysis is to help people as well as myself to see a better picture of the field as of now and its growth since 2020.
